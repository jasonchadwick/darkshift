# NO LONGER BEING WORKED ON (jasonchadwick/chronodrifter is more interesting)

# Darkshift: a relativistic puzzle game

It's a bit weird because we observe the player from above, but the effects are what
the player would experience from their own perspective.

### TODO:
- color change
- length contraction: update collision boxes to match
- time travel??? (faster than c)
- enemies/levels
- more interesting art
- information travels towards the observer at speed of light?
- figure out what to do about collisions being disorienting
